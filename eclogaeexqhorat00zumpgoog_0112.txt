chamutum LIB. 11.

Nymphasque discentes et aures

Ca ripedum Satyrorum acutas.
llvoe! recenti mens trepidat metu,

Plenoque Bacchi pectore turbidum

Laetatur. Evoel parce, Liber,

Parce, gravi metuende thyrso.

Fas pervicaces est mihi Thyiadas
Viniqus fontem, lactis et uberes
Cautare rivos atque truncis
Lapsa cavis iterare melta,

Fas et beatae conjugis dditum
Stellis honorem tectaque leuthei
Disjecta non leni ruina
Thracis et exitium Lycurgi.

Tu flectis amnes, tu mare barbarum,
Tu separatis uvidus in jugis
