Mysten ademptum, nec tibi Vespero
Surgente decedunt amores ·
Neo rapidum fugiente solem.

At non ter aevo functus kmabilem
Ploravit ornnes Antilochum senex
humaneque impubem parentes
Troilon aut Phrygiae sorores

Flevere semper. Desine mollium
Tandem querelarum, et potius nova
Cantemus Augusti tropaea
Caesaris et rigidum Niphaten, 20

Medumque flumen gentibus additum
Victis minores volvere vertices,
Intraque praescriptum Gelonos
Exiguis equitare campis.

12. flagitate, scil. Vespero, or rather, with its morning name, Luci-
fero, ‘when the morning star flees besara the hastenmg sun ;’ that
rs, when day breaks—13. Tarusco unctus-senaa, Nestor of
Pylos, who, according to Homer, live to such an age thut he saw
lour generations or ages os men. His son Antilochus was killed by
Memnon before the walls os Troy—16. Troilus was a son of
Priam, who, thou h young and weak, engaged in unequal striso
with Achilles, and was slain by him—17¹ Desine querelarum, a
Greek construction, lor which, rn prose Latrn, the accusative qne·
relus would have to be used- 20. Niphaten. a mountain ol Arme·
nia, here employed to designate the whole os that country. Simi-
larly in the next line the river Medus, which fulls into the Araxes,
near the city ol Persepolis, is used sor the Parthians, who dwell on
its banks. Hence it is said minores vertices volvere, a mixed figure;
lor volvere is quite pro erly used of the rolling ol a river, but
vertes oanbe said only ol tho person who is made not to carry ‘his
head’sohrgh. Wrthmirtores vertices the Englrsh phrase‘ rmm·
iahed hesds' may be compared—23. Gelonos, a tribe of the Scy·
thiens who dwelt in Europe. The poet says of thern, that tlte pre·
datory inroads which they had been in the habit ol' makin into tha
Roman dominions wera now revented; ‘ that the ride only in their
own narrow territories, within the bounds marked out to them¹
(turra praescriptum.) All this praise os the victorias ol Augustus
refers tutha facts, that in the year 20 s.c., Phraates, king os the

Parthians, acknowledged the supremacy of Rome, and restored the

booty and captives taken in previous campaigns3 and that Tiberius,
tha ate son ol Au ustus, with the help ol a Roman army, estab-

lished 'ligranes as ing os Armenia.
