DARMINUM ΗΒ. 111.

Velox mente noval quibus
Antris egregii Caesaris audiar
Aeternum meditans decus
Stellis inserere et concilio Jovist
Dicam insigne recens adhuc
Indictum ore alio. Non secus in jugis
Exsomnis stupet Evias‚
Hebrum prospiciens et nive candidam
Thracen ac ede barbaro
Lustralem Rhodopen, ut mihi devio
Ripae et vacuum nemus
Mirari libet. ONaiadurn potens
Baccharumque, valentium
Proceras manibus vertere fraxinon,
Nil parvum aut humili modo,
Nil mortale loquar. Dulce periculum est,
’ OLenaee‚ sequi deum
Cingentem viridi tempora pampino. 20

8. Non secas is to be connected with ot in line 12. The prose ex-
. pressiori is non secus oc. ‘Not otherwise does the Bacchant feel
enthusiasm than Ι shall do.' 'l'he Bacchant is called Euius, from
Euius, the surname of Bacchus. See i. 18, 9. She is called exsom-
nis, because she celebrates her rites in the night. The chief seat
of the Bacchantes was Thrace, where the river Hebrus and the
mountain-range of Rhodope were. Tho inhabitants were called by
the Greeks, in the strict use of the word, barbarione: hence in line
11. pede barbaro-12. Decio, ‘wandering away from the abodcs of

men.'·-14. Naiadum poteram namely, Bacchus. Compare i. 3, 13

he Bacchic frenzy was said to give the worncn such strength that
they could root up trees with their hands-18. Dulce perieulum. It
