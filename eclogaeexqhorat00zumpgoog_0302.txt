AD nsotrae.

Trns poem has caused more differencs of opinion among the com-
mentatus than any other of Horace's writings. Some have con-
sidered it aa intended to be a complete system of the principles
of poetica} composition3 others as merely a friendly letter; and
both parties have found something to censure in it The truth
lies between the two opinions. As Horace in several of his
trenetur l n strettun
reparding the art of poetry‚ so berg in the easy sorm Joi* ἕ letter ’
to friends, he gives his views os the art, formed by the experi-
ence oft life dedicated to the Muses. Hence this book is a
satirical didactic poem, in which need be expected neither philo-
sophicnl form and arrangement, nor any great flight os fancy.
This epistle‚ if not the last of our poet’s writings, is at least a
work ot* his mature age, oompoeed probably between 11 and8
ac.. and we may suppose him to have lest it aa a kind of rule
by which he wished posterity to try his poetry. The epistle is
addressed to L Piso, consul in 15 aa, a man distinguished ns a
general and statesman, and particularly sor the ability with
which he discharged the dutiee osproqfectus urbi,· and to his
two sons, the elder of whom was from seventeen to twenty years
of age at the time that Horace wrote it-a period ot' lise at
which interest in poetry very commonly develops itself.
