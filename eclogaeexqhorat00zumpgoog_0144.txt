Quo Chium pretio cadum 5
Mercemur, quis aquarn temperet ignibus,
Quo praebente domurn et quota
Pelignis ceream frigoribus, taces.

Da lunae propere noves,

Da noctis mediae, da puer· auguris
Murenae. Tribus aut novem
Miscentur cyathis pocula commodis.

Qui Musas amat impares,

Ternas ter cyathos attonitus petet
Vates 3 tres prohibet supra
Riaarum metuens tangere Gratia

Nudis juncta sororibus. ,

Insauire Juvat. Cur Berecyntiae

a standing phrase in Homer, Ἴλιος ἵρη. -6, Qut's aquam temperet
'amaa ‘who makes the water beatable. comfortably tepid, hy
re ;' that is, who preparas warin baths. We are perhaps to under·
stand the reference to he to public baths, the excellent-es or defecta
of which were a suitable subject for table-talk. -7. Quo praebente,
duc. This is to be understood of an inn or tavena-keeper, who leta*
one of his rooms to a company. ffuota scil. hora, ‘at what hour.’-
8. Peligaia frigorihuetthat is, col such as prevails amongl the Apen-
nines‚ where the Pelrgnr dwell. Hence we see that t e ode was
written in winter.-9. Da, supply cyathum, ‘give me a cup, nouae
lunae, to drinlt to the new moon’ Compare iit 8, 13.-10. Noctie
mediae, ‘to drink to midnight‚' to which we mean to extend our
caronsal. Auguris Murenae, ‘to the health of our augur Murena 3’
that is, to the heulth of our friend Murena, who has recently ob·
tained the priestly office of augur. Who this Murena was is uncer-
tain-ll. Tribus aut nauem, ete. The sense may be gethered from
the following explanation :-A oculum, one of the large cups out
of which the Romans drank, hefd about as much as twelve cyath-
small cups which were used for taking the wine from the pircher.
Now tho wine was very seldom drunk unmixed‚ and there were
chiefly two degrees ol' mixture: first, three cyathi af wine, in nine
al water; that is, only one-fourth being wine-this was the mix·
ture commonly preferred; and secondly, three cyathi of water in
nine uf wine, thus three-fourths being wine. This latter mixture
pleases the poet. who means to put himself into an inspired (attoni-
tas, enthusiastie) state of mind. He would have even three more
athi ofwine (line 15, tres sopra, ‘three besides,' besides the nine);
illst is. he would drink his wine pure, but this would itttoxicate him,
arrd multe him ofl'end the Graces3 that is. transgress the tules ol'
propriety.-l2. Commodis, a poetical construction for tlte adverb
commode, ‘suitably‚ properly, comfortably.'-l3. impares, because
there were nine, an odd number.- 17. Nudic jactato sororibus, for
the Graces are often represented united, twined tn each other’s arms.
-18, The llutes are called Berecyntiae, because they were esea 'xp
the worship of the Mater magam and betecyntus'tsamauxxxaxxxw
