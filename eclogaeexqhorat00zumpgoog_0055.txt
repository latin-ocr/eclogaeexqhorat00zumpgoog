Q. Hosnrrr nuncet

Saeva paupertas et avitus apto .
Cum lare fundus.

Crescit, occulto velut arbor aevo,
Fama Marcelli. Micat inter omnes
Julium sidus, velut inter ignes
Luna minores.

Gentis humanae peteretque custos,
Orte Saturno, tibi cura magni
Caesaris fatis data: tu secundo
Caesare regnes.

Ille seu Parthos Latio imminentes
Egerit justo domitos triumpho,

Siye subjectos Orientis orae
Seras etlndos,

Te minor latum reget aequus orbem;

Tu gravi curru quaties Olympum,

—43.''Saeo⁸e=duru. Apte mem lare, ‘with a suitable house ;' that
is,a house suitable for a poor man, who himself cultivated the
small piece of ground that e inberited lrom his lorefathers. -45,
Velut orbor occulto oeno, ‘ like a trec whose growth is not observed ς’
that is, gradually. Marcellus was at this time in his seventeenth
year, an had just begun to garn honour by his conduct in official·
poste—47. Jnlium sidus,· that is, Augustus: the force os tbe
expression is, ‘Julius (C. Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus)
gleaming like a star.’ The connection os the thoughts is, ‘the
anre of Marcellus is growing gradually, but that ol Augustus is
already most brilliant! Ignes-minores=atellas minores-50.
Orte Saturno, ‘son ol Saturn3' namely, Jupiter. Compare lina
13.—5r. Trt secando Caesare regnes, ‘reign with Caesar next be·
low thee.' In prose we should say, ‘let Caesar rule next to thee.'
-54, Egerit justo-triumpho. The triumph over the Parthians, t
whose territory extended close to the Roman dominions (hence Latio
imminentes), is called ‘just,’ because they had before by stratagem
conquered M. Crassus and M. Antonius, aad almost annihilated
their armies. This was the main cause why Augustus, from the
very beginning of his reign, meditated a campaign against the Par·
thiens-55. Subjectos Orientis oroe=subjorentes, ‘situated or
living under the sky ol' the Enstt' ora here is ‘tract or quanter of
heaven.' About the year 24 s.c., Augustus sent his lieutensnt·
general, Aelius Gallus, on an expedition into Arabis Felix. lts re-
sults were very trilling; in lact, it was a hilare—57. Te minor, ‘in-
serior to thee, next to thee, under thee.' Aequus. ‘merciful and just.’
- 58-60. The idea is this: ‘as Augustus rules justly on earth, so do
thou reign in heaven by thy thunder, which makes lrnown thy power;
und by thy lightning, by which thou punishest such as offerrd thee.'
“ Properly, the order should have been iuveytcd: ‘as thou rulest in
heaven, so nray Augustus rule on earth.'-58. Gravicnrrn. Accord-
