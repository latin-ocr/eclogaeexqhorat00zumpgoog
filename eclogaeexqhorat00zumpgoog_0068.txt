caeMINUM LIB. 1.

Sive facturus per inhospitalem
Caucasum vel quae loca fabulosus
⁴ Lambit Hydaspes.

Namque me silva lupus in Sabina,
Dum meam canto Lalagen et ultra
Terminum curis vagor expeditis,
Fugit inermem:

Quale portentum neque militaris
Daunias latis alit aesculetis,

Nec Jubae tellus generat, leonum
Arida nutrix.

Pone me, pigris ubi nulla campis
Arbor aestiva recreatur aura,

Quod latus mundi nebulae malusque
Jupiter urget:

one sub curru nimium propinqui
Solis in terra domibus negata:
Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo,
Dulce loquentem.
