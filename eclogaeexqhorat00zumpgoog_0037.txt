Q. HORATII FLAGGI

Quem javat clamor galeaeque leves,
Acer et Mauri peditis cruentum ·
Vultus in hostem.

Sive mutata juvenem figura
Ales in terris imitaris, altnae
Filius Maiae, patiens vocari
Caesaris ultor,

Serus in coelum redeas, dinque
Laetus intersis populo Quirini,
Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum
Ocior aura

Tollat. Hic magnos potius triumphos,
llic ames diei Pater atque Princeps,
Neu sinas Medos equitare inultos,
Te duce, Caesar.

-38, Leues, ‘smooth, polished, burnished.’-39. Construe thus: et
vallas Mauri peditis acer iu cruentam hostem. The look ol' the
Mauritanian soldier is fierce at all times. but particularly when he
is lancing at an enemy whom he has wounded or alain-41. The
author now comes to the main point of his poem; namely, the state·
ment that ‘Octavianus Caesar had been sent hy the gods to save tha
Romans. He ventures on the fancy that Mercury, the son of tha
goddess Maia, had assumed tlte form of Octavian, and had conda-
scended (therefore, in line 43, patiens) to become the avenger cf
Caesar's murder. Siue-juvenem in terris imitaris, ‘or if thou ltast
assumed, and art bearin on earth the form of young Octavian,' who
was then in his thirty-fitia year-43. Filias, nominative lor vocative.
See Grom. l 311, note-45. Servus, a poetical construction for sero.
-47- Nostris vitiis iniquum, ‘hostile, opposed to our saults.’-49.
Hic polias, ‘here on earth rather than in heaven, where, as Mer·
cury, thou usually dwellest.’ The accusative triumphos dependo upon
amsa-50. Pater, scil. patmos, a title which was alterwards formally
conferred on Octavianus by a decree of the senate-51. Medos,-
that is, the Parthians. Octavianus, like his grand-uncle J nlius, in· ·
tended to commence a war against this people, alter settling tha
internal affairs of tlte state. His motivo was a desire to avenge on
the Parthians the descats which M. Crassus and Antony the trium-
vir had sustained at their hands,'and particularly to deliver the
Roman captives, of whom they had still avery great number, and
to recover tlte standards.
