GARMEN 111.

Ao MELPOMENEN.

Ι Oon to the Musa, in which Horace acknowledges that at last, alter
much envy end disparagement, he has obtained some recognition
os his rnerits as a poet.

Quam tu, Melpomene, semel

Nascentem lacido lumine videris,

Illum uon lahor Isthmius

Clarabit pugilem, non equus impiger
Curru ducet Achaico

Victorem, neque res bellica Deliis

Ornatam foliis ducem,

Quod regum tumidas contuderit minas,
Ostendet Capitolio:

Sedquae Tiberaquae fertile praefluunt 10 ¹

Et spissae nemorum comae

Fingent Aeolio carmine nobilem.
Romae, principis urbium, . χ

Dignatur soboles iuter amabiles

Vatum ponere me choros,

Et jam dente minus mordeor invido.
Ο testudinis aureae

Dulcem quae strepitum, Pieri, temperas,

4. The verb clarore is antique and rare. The common word is
militare. Comparenetemore in iv. 14, 5.—5. Curre-eictorem, an
allusion to the sect that the victore in the Grecian gemes used to
enter their native city triumphantly, riding in a chariat. The sense
os the whole passage is: istrie muse is favoureble ro a man, he will
not, is a Greek, strive in the gemes to attain the highest honour
which could fall to the lotos any one iu Greece3 nor, if a Roman,
will he prosecute amilitar life, and gain fame thereby. —6. Deliis
ὗοέἰίεῐ hemely, lauro, which was sacred to Apollo, the god os

los-8. Regum. Most of the natione with which the Romans
carried on war were governed by iringo, particularly the Eastern
natione. Of their tumidae minoe, ‘ewelling-thattis, engry or
boastiul-threats,’ Horace could spealr with great justice-10. The ·
sense ie: he who has a poetical genius will cultivate it in solitude,
and thus malie himself famous-12. Fingeot, = officient, ‘will make
him, will so train dud inspiro him that he will become illustrrous.'-
l4. Soholes here = po lus. Roma is here conceived as a goddess,
whose children the omens are. Amoliles should properie hanc
been joined conatusne-17. Aureae, attenuent apathes oh iffi xxixa-,⁶
expressive of its excellence. -18, Pieri. 'ihs arnamar χι aare.
