Honrcu makes his friend and brother poet Fundanius(seei.10,
ta) describe a feast which Nasidienus Rufus¹ a meu who with
debanchery combined a certain degree of avarica, had girante
Maecenas and his train. The couches, as we seo from lineat
and following, were thus arranged :—

(1) Fundanius; (2) Viscus; (³) Varius; (4) Servilius; (⁵)
Maecenas; (fi) Vibidius3 (7) Nomentanus3 (8) Nasidienus3
(9) Porcius. It is worthy of remark, that the arrangements os
the table correspond with the rules which Horace lays down'in
the etth satire of this book. Perhaps, therefore, in thnt satire
Nasidienus is tc be loohed upon as thc inventor of the precepta.

‘Ur Nasidieni juvit te coena beati?
