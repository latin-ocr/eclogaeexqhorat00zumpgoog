The poet himself was therefore sreeborn (iugemns); and this
fact, considering the great number of freedmen who lived at
Rome, and rose to wealth and influence, was of itself something
to 66 proud of (compare Sat. i. 6, 7.) Horace aclmowledges his
bumble birth; but his education, he says, was equal to that of
y one destined for the highest position in society, although his
father would have been satisfied if his son had followed the,
earne calling as himself-eamely, that of a caedor (Sat. i. 6, 86) 3
or, as Suetonius in Horace's life more sully says, medanum
macter ,· that is, an agent of the argentarii, who, for a certain per-
centage or commission, collected from purchasers at auctions the
money due for what they had bought The father, however, was
besides the possessor of a small estate near Venusia.

The school at Venusia, though the town was a considerable
one, aud wealthy‚ was yet but second-rate. It was good enough,
however, for boys intended for handicrasts or a mercantile life;
writing and arithmetic were taught; and even the higher class
os citizens-the magni centuriones, as the poet calls thern (Sat. i. 6,
7³)-were content with it. But young Flaccus was taken by his
father to Rome, to be educated there. The father himself lenuis
home, settled in the capital, and accompanicd his son to all the
teachers whom 66 attended. The poet praises this conduct as
very sels-sacrificing, and considers himself fortunate in having
6666 thus preserved from the follies and seductione to which
youth is liable in a large city: (compare the whole os Satire 6,
6666 i.) Horace studied’in Rome Latin and Greek grammar ;
and afterwards, under the same teachers, rhetoric. He mentions
(Epist. ii. 1, ⁷1) that, wlren a boy, he attended the school of tbe
grammarian Orbilius, who used to dictate passages from the
writings of the old Latin poet Livius Andronicus, and give gram·
matical prelections on rhem. He also states (Epist. ii. ta), that
Homer was explained to him, no doubt by a Greek grammarian.
In such studies Horace's life passed on, till it became time for
bim tc decide whether 66 would enter into public life or not.
To do so 66 had to become either 66 advocate ora soldier.
He was not inclined to adopt either profession3 for the latter,
indeed, he probably bad not physical strength. Besides, the
Roman state seerned falling to pisces: rba civil war came on,
then tbe murder of Caesar. Horace withdrew from tbis scene
of confusion3 and aner the fashion of high-born Roman youths,
went to Athens to pursue his studies, especially in philosophy.
His father appears to have been dead by this time. The most
distinguished philosopher then teaching at Athens was Cratippus
the peripatetic, to whom Cicero had sent bis son. Horace men·
tiens (Epist. ii. 2, to) that be had attended the discourses of a
peripatetic-probably Cratippus. He felt happy in the quiet and
