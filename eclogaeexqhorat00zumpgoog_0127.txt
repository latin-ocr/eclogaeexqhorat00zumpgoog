Q. HORATII abacta

Qui terram inertem, qui mare temperat
Ventosum et urbes regna ue tristia,
Divosque mortalesque tur as
Imperio regit unus aeque.

Magnum illa terrorem intulerat Jovi
Fidens juventus horrida brachiis,

Fratresque tendentes opaco
Pelion imposuisse Olympo:

Sed quid Typhoeus et validus Mimas,
Aut quid minaci Porphyrion statu,
Quid Rhoetus evulsisque truncis
Enceladus jaculator audax

Contra sonantem Palladis aegida
Possent ruentesl Hinc avidus stetit
Vulcanus, hinc matrona luno et,
Nunquam humeris positurus arcum,

Qui rore puto Castaliae lavit
Crines solutos, qui Lyciae tenet
Dumeta natalemque silvam,
Delius et Patareus Apollo.

Vis consili expers mole ruit sua, 65
Vim temperatam di quoque provehunt
