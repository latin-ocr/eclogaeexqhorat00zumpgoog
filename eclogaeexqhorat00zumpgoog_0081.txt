AD FORTUNAM.

Α aaaron to the goddess Fortune, that she may protect Octavianus
and the Roman army, who, in the year 27 a.c.‚ moditated dn
expedition to Britain. Julius Caesar, during his Gallio wars,
had boen twice in tha island, and had subdued tlre tribes residing
on and near the coast. But nster his departure these had not

stroke by submitting‚ in form at least, to the Romans, and
acknowlcdging their supremacy.
