tranouillity of Athens, and attended closely ιο his studies.= He

attempted also the composition of Greek verses; but gave it up, -
sceing that in Greek poetry no laureis were now to be won,
whereas the Latin literatureof his time had but few great poete
to point to (Sat. i. 10, 31.) His quiet was broken in upon by
the civil war, of which the republican party, under Brutus and*
Cassius, transferred the seat to Graece. Young Horace was
enthusiastic for liberty, whose representative Brutus was eonsi-
dered ιο be. He therefore joined the republican army asa volun·
teer, and was soon advanced by Brutus to the rank of tribunae
inditum This was a high honour for the son of e sreedman to
obtain, especially dne who had no great fortune; consequently
envious enemies were not wanting, but still he was able to main·
tain his position. He seems ιο have visited Asia Minor with
Brutue-at least is he was an eye-witness of the occurrence
which he describes in Sat. i. 7. In 42 a. c., however, he returned
to Greece, and took part in the battle of Philippi. Alter thie
battle-in which the republicans were defeated, and the leaders
fell by their own hande—the greater partos tbe troops entered
the service of the ninnivite, the officere were dismissed,and only
a few continued the war under Sex. Pompeius and Domitius
Ahenobarbus. Horace, in Odes, ii. 7, 9, describes himself as
having been among the fugitives, saying that be had lest his
shield on the field ol battle. As soon as the state of politica
permitted, he returned to Italy, and went to Rome, where alone
be could hope to riso by his abilities.

His patrimonial estate, which had never been large, had during
the civil war been quite lost (Epist. ii. 2, 50), not by the proscrip-
tions, by which the triumvirs had attempted to al ter the condition
of Italy-for Horace was too humble to be affected by thern-
bnt by the general calamities of the country. The triumvirs had
ιο reward the soldiers who had assisted them against the repub·
lican party, and this could be done only by granting thern small
estates. ln the most flourishing cities of Italy the owners of land
were obliged to give up their property to the soldiers. Compen-
sation in money was promised indeed, but could nothe given at
once, because the state treasury had been too thoroughlydrained»
during the constant wars of the period3 and it is very doubtful
whether sull paymentwesever made. Octavianus settled a colony
of veterans at Venusia, and Horace's estate was one of those
assigned ιο them. How washe now to live'l Thebloodyand deso·

secured peace for a while, produced a reaction: people began
ιο rejoice in peace, and feel a longing after its arts. But elo·
