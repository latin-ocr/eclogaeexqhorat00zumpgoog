Mentes asperioribus
Formendae studiis Nescit equo rudis
Haerere ingenuus puer 55
venarique timet, ludere doctior,
Seu Graeco jubeas trocho,
Seu malis vetite legibus alca,
Cum perjura patris fides
Consortem socium fallat et hospitem,
indignoque pecuniam
Heredi properet. Scilicet improbae
Crescunt divitiae; temen
Curtae nescio quid semper abest rei.

entrance of foreign, particularly Greek manners-54. Equo hoe·
rere, nearly equivalent to equo veli, ‘to ride ;’ but with a touch ot'

Rudis, ‘inexperienced;’ namel, in riding-57. Trocho. The

means, even by dishonesty, to make money. Hence ‘t
word of the lather’ is equivalent to ‘the lether, who breaks his
word and his oath.’ -60, Consortem sociam, ‘his pertner in busi-
ness ;’ scr this is the proper sense os consors. one who hes, along
with another, a sora, capital, lor carrying on business-62. Pro·
peret = propere paret, ‘is hurriedly nequirrng.’ Scilicet, here ‘ notu·
rally,’ ‘it rs not to be wondercd at mats-64. Certae rei = mancae,
nimis parvae rer'somiliart'. So the lether thinks at least, since,
never content with what he hes, he is always secking more wealth.
