AD O· ASINIUM POLLIONEM. .

. C. Asrmus Pontio, in whose praise thie ode was written, was, both
from his high birth, and from his distinction in the political aa
well as literary world, one of the leading men of his time.

⁸ When bnt 0 youth he came prominently forward as an orator,
for we find him in 75 0. 0., in 1110 twenty-third year, accusing C.
Cato. After this 110 served under Caesar, and during the civil
wars atter Caesar’s death, he held on independent command.

’ 111 the year 43 ac. he decided 1110 fall of the republican party
by siding with Marlr Antony, when defeated and a fugitive, and
bringing about the triumvirate of Octavianus, Antony, and
Lepidus. ln the year 40 a. c. he was consul, and received in
the following year the province of Illyricum. Whilst in this
command, 110 conquered the barborous tribes of the Parthini
and Dalrnstians, and took the town of Salonae. For these
victorico he, on the 25th October 39 ae, celebrated a triumph,
which was called the Dalmatian. In the quarrels between
Octavianus and Antony he attempted, so long as it was possible,
to act as mediator, inclining, however, more 10 the party of the
latter, and he could 1101 be prevailed upon, even before the
campaign of Actium, when 1110 ruin of Antony seemed certain, “
and all his former friends were leaving him, 10 take the field
against him. He was too proud, and too much imbued with the
old republican spirit, to serve under Octavianus. During the
time when these disputes andi quarrels were going on, and when
110 could not be politically active, he turned bis attention to
literature, and wrote tragedies and historioal worlrs; among the
“ latter, especially, a history of the last civil wara, from the year
60 a. c. iim consulship of L. Afranius and Q. CaeciliusMetellus),
when w at is called the first triumvirate was formed by Pompey‚
Caesar, and Crassus. lt is to be lamented, that of all Pollio's
writings nothing except the very smellest fragments has come
down tc us.
710 praise which Horace bestows upon Pollio in this ode refers
merely tobis distinction as a historiam of bis polrbeal 011111 aab
