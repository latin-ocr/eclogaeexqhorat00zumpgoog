Incolumi Rhodos et Mitylene pulchra facit, quod
Paenula solstitio, campestre nivalibus auris,
Per brumam Tiberis, Sextili mense caminus.

Te dicas: nam si ratio et prudentia curas, 25
Non loeus effusi late maris arbiter, aufert,
Coelum, non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt.
Strenua nos exercet inertia3 navibus atque
Quadrigis petimus bene vivere. Quod petis, hic est,
Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit aequus. 3t
