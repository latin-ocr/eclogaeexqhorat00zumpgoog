An CAESAREM AUGUSTUM.

An ode to Augustus, in which ho is praised in a beautiful ond
polished manner, but truthfully. Horace extols in him the
genuinely Roman virtue 01 perseverance and firmnoss (constantio),
and shows that by it all tho great heroes who, according to the
belief 01 1110 ancients, had beon raised to tho position 01 gods
hod obtained their farne. He considers Augustus ns belonging
to this class, and 101001 there was nothing in tho emperor so
well worthy 01 praise astho determination and steadiness by
which, when a young man, he overeame the greatest obstacles,
aad reached his aim. The poet spends a considerable tirne in
describiug how Romulus was assumed into the number 011110
gods, no doubt with the view that Augustus should he pointed to

{sla second Romulus. 'l'ho ode was written about the 'year

Josrun et tenacem propositi virum
Non civium ardor prava jubentium, ⁸
Non vuitus instantis tyranni
Mente quatit solida, neque Auster,
Dux inquieti turbidus Hadriae,

N ee iulrnrnantismagna manus Jovist
Si tractus illabatur orbis,
impavidum ferient ruinae.

- llac arte Pollux et vagos Hercules
Enisus arces attigit igneas,
Quos inter Augustus recumbens
Purpureo bibit ore nectar. ¹
