cannen siccaniae.

ln the year 17 a. c. Augustus celebrated the ludi saeculares. These
were instituted iu the earliest times of Rome, to mark with
solemnity the longest period to which human life was supposed
ever to extend: but it wasa disputed point whether cucculum in
regard to these gamos meantes in common usage, espace of
100, or, in a peculier religious sense, 110 years. Both views
found supporters. Augustus, afier the pacification of the em·
pire, wishing to reawahen the religious feeling of the people,
which during the long civil ware had almost⁸ died away, re-
solved to re'vive these games, which, as Suetonius (August. 31)
tells us, had fellen into disuse. He ordered the Sibyllino books
to be consulted} and these, taking the cycle of 110 years, stated
the year and the mode of celebrating the festival. The next
who celebrated these gemes was tho Emperor Claudius, a. n. 47
(mue. 800), following the cyclo of 100 years; then a. n. 88
(auc. 841), Domitian, and an. 204 (au. c. 957), Septimius
Severus, again following the rechoning of Augustus; and lastly,
an. 247 (ano. 1000), Philippus. 'l'he seeular gemes lasted
for three days, beginning in the evcning and continuing during
the night. They consisted in the offering of various sacrifices to
all the gods of Rome (hence, in line 7, Dia, quibua ceptam pic
cuere colles), and are fully described by Zosimus, ii. 5.

Toheighten the interest of the festival, Augustus requested from
Horace a cannen saeculare, which was to be sung by a choir of
boys and girls. Many commentatore have been of opinion that
the song is a so-called cannen emaciatum,- that is, consists of
uanus intended to be sung alternately by the boys and girls.
But this opinion finds no confirmation in the poem iucif, equally
little in the description which we have of the proceedings at the
gemes, and is altogether improbable. In the aesthetic criticism
of the poem, we must remember tlrat it was an official composi-
tion, in which no high flight of poetic fancy could be allowed.
It is addressed to Apollo and Diana, to whom the Sibyllina books
directed a poem as well as a sacrifice to be offered.
