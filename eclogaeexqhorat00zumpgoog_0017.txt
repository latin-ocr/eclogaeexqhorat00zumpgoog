smouldering ashes of political ranconr, would have to let slip the
trutb, and flattertlre ruling party. Under these circumstances,
men of ability took refuge in poetry arrd the regionsof fancy; aud
little else was heard now in the intellectual circles of Rome but
recitatione of poetry aud criticisms thereon. Among tlte dis·
tinguisbed poets of tha time we may mention especially Virgil,
whose charming pastorale had deligbted all, and gained for him
the favour and patronage of Octavianus; aleo Varius, who had
recommended himself by a poem on the death of casm and
many others, ιο whom Horace occasionally alludes. Horace, too,
felt an inclination towards poetry: he says (Epist. ii. 251) that
'poverty‚ which impels men to bold undertakings‚ had driven him
to attempt verse-making. He sought in poetry the means of sub·
alstemo, by writing occasional verses. These were not directly
paid for, butpresents were sentin acknowledgment of thern, and
they gained for him the patronage of wealthy men, on whose
bounty be lived. He soon became known to bis brother poete at
Rome 5 and first Virgil, then Varius, spoke of him to Maecenas.
The latter invited Horace to visit him, and asired him a few ques·
tione about his family. Horace anawered timidly and modestly.
Maecenas then dismissed him without any definite promise; and
it was not till nine months thereafler that he again summoned
him. and made lrim one of bis friends (amici.) This happened
probably in the beginning of the year 40 a. c.

Maecenas hae been richly repaid for hia kindnese to Horace by
the praises which the latter everywhere bestows upon him, and
which bave made bis nemea current word for ‘a patronos litera·
ture! He was one of the most influential men in Rome;'not from
his rank or birtb; but purely from his political shill and sagacity.
He was descended from an ancient but not a noble family 3 for
none of his ancestors had held any curule office in Rome. He
wasa simple Roman knight, and inclined ιο remain so: though
osten invited to taire office, he always declined, preferring the
quiet of private life, which his wealth enabled him ιο enjoy, ιο
the activity of a bustling political career. He was the friend
and confidant of Octavianus, whom he aided with his advice and
cooperation in the most critical situationa3 and ιο whom be was
eo much attached, that at the time of tlte battle of Actium (³0
a. a), and previously, when Octavianus was obliged to bo absent
from the city, he undertoolr the responsible and laborious office
of proej'ecttc ordi. This confidence of Octavianus in Maecenas,
being well known ιο a'll, raised the latter in actual power above
most men in tha state, and all aspirante ιο the emperor’e favour
flocked to pay their homage ιο Maecenas. He was at the same
time well acquainted with, and hadaline taeta forliterature,and
toolr the despest interestin it He attempted poetry himself too.
