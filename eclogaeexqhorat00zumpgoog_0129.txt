Q. nonam muel

chanun V.

An ode written in the year 20 s. c, when Augustus, by threats of
war, compelled Phraates, king of the Parthians, to restore the
Roman standands, aud the large number of Roman prisoners that
had sallem into the hands of his nation in the unfortunate expe·
ditions of M. Crassus and M. Antonius. Some short time before ·
this, Britain, which Augustus, desirous of carrying out the pro·

irem of his adoptive father Caesar, had threatened with war,
ad, nominally at least, submitted to the Roman power. See

Odes, i. 35, 30, and 21,15. The joy in Rome at both events

was great, and Horace expresses his in this ode. He begins

with a description of the disgracesul servitude of the Romans
among the Parthians, and then shows by the example of Regulus,
that to ransom them would have been base and injurious. But
as Augustus has by threats of war forced their restoration, he

must be considered as a god.
