ona to Calliope, the muse of heroic poetry. In inclity, however, it
is a laudatiora of Augustus. Asin the preceding poem Horace
had praised his firmasse, so here he extols his foresight‚ pru-
dence (amam), and the essence or substance of the whole ode
is to be found in lines 65-68. Augustus exhibited this prudencs
in three distinct ways: first, in the conquest of the troops which
opposed him (line 42 to the eud), particularly those of Antony‚
and Horace represents his battle with him as that of Jupiter
against the giants aud Titana secondly, in his mildness after
the victory (line 41); and thirdly‚ in his litei-ary occupatione and
enjoymeuts during peace (lines 37-40.) The giver of this pru.
denos is Calliope, to whom also the poet has dedicated himself.
Hence bis right to sing the emperor's praises in an ode to the
ruane. Tha expansiou of this thought forms the introductiou
(lines l-et)
