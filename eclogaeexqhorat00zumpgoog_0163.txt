Quod spiro et placeo, si placeo, tuum est.

OARMEN IV.

DRUSI LAUDES.

Onrr in praise of Claudius Drusus Nero, the younger brother of the

’ Emperor Tiberius, ond stepson of Augustus. The two brothers
hed, in the year 15 a. o.‚ carried on an orduone but succesefirl
war against the Raetians and Vindeliclans. Dmsus, then a
youth of twenty-three, had become particularly deor to the
Roman people3 because they believed that, if he reached the
throne, he would restore thc ancient freedom.

Horace, with great ekill, eo constructa his ode as to give even
greater praise to Augustus than to Drusus3 for to the emperor’rr
training he attributes the young man's tolents and successes.
