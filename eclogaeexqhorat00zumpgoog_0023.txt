book of tha Odes. The second book of Epistles appeared some
what later still. HisEpistle on theArt of Poetry appears tc have

It {hay here be asked, What is it that gives Horace his
aclmowladged valuel He is a poet of reality, trained in the world
and for the world, full of elegant remarks, pleasant and kindly
sentimenta, averse to all rough merriment, and impelled by his
genius ιο clothe his observatione in the garb of poetry. He is
an amiable man and a thorough gentleman; but what makes
him a poet is not an inspiration cr wild impulseof the soal, but
the quiet deliberation which enables him to give his reflections
the most beautiful form possible· He worlrs with the greatest
care, and strives ιο attain perfection in his style of represen-
tation and expression. He is great, because he thoroughly
understands, aa an artist, all his immediate relations, and raises
the individual ιο the universal. ln bis lyric poema he despises
the dithyrambis strein of thought; andita wantis made up by
noble sentimenta, and by freedom from faults; for of bombast
and want of correctness nothing is ιο be found in them. Many
of his Odes are imitated from the Greek, but he has dona it
skilfully, and without lavishly following his modale, and his
poema are even superior ιο the originals in polish end in unity

in regard to odes-namely, Valerius Catullus, a poet of great
ability and genius, but who wrote very little, and made, ias it
were, merely a beginning. In regard to epodes‚ Horace, as it
appears, was the only one of the Romans who attempted them.
The idea of this lrindof poetry he derived from the Greek Archi·
lochos, whose celebrated satirical poems were written in iambica,
but their form he himself invented. The name of epodi is
taken from the fact, that in tbe majority of them the first verse
is a somewhat long tine, then following it, or in addition to it '
(lat), one shorter. The epistle, aa a kind of poetry, is entirely an
invention of Horace. There was nothing like it in ancient litera-
ture before his time, and he had but feable imitators in claudian
and Ausonius, who lived in the fourth century after Christ His
Epistles are really letters, containing personal allusione, and
sentimenta (sor example, Epist. i. 3, and 9) not going beyond
private matters. But in others he goes from private affairs ιο
general observatione ou life and art The epistle, with Horaee’s
ss patterns, has been a favourite species of poetry among the
moderas. The satira was not invented by Horace, but he re-
