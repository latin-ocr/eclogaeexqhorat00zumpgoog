ao a. murman.

'Art exhortation to L. Licinius Varro Murena to guard against
extremes. Prosperity and advorsity have their turn in the life
of almost every man. Licinius needed this advice, and would
have been more happy and fortunate had he followed it. He
displayed towards all a candour aud openncss of speech which
gained him many cnemies; and in the year 22 aa, when a
conspiracy against the life of Augustus was discovered, iu which
he was involved, he was put to death.

Semper urgendo neque, dum procellas
Cautus horrescis, nimium premendo

Decirlunt turres leriuntque summos
Fulgura montes.

Alteram sortem bene praeparatum
Pectus. lulormes hiemes reducit 15
