sni tor abhinc annos centurn qui decidit, inter
'Peritietos veteresque referri debet an inter
Viles atque novosl Excludat jurgia finis.
Est vetus atque probus, centurn qui perficit annos.
Quidt qui deperiit minor uno mense vel anno, 40
Inter quos referendus erit? veteresne poetas,
An quos et praesens et postera respuat asrael
, ‘Iste quidem veteres inter ponetur honeste,
Qui vel mense brevi vel toto est junior anno.’
Utor' permisso, caudaeque pilosut equinae 45
Paullatim vello et demo unum, demo et item unum,
Dum cadat elusus, ratione ruentis acervi,
Qui reditio fastos et virtutem aestimat annis
Miraturque nihil, nisi quod Libitina sacravit.
Ennius et sapiens et sortis et alter Homerus,
Ut critici dicunt, leviter curare videtur,
Quo promissa cadant et somnia Pythagorea.
Naevius in manibus non est et mentibus haeret
Paene recens? adeo sanctum est vetus omne poema.

Dicitur Afrani toga convenisse Menandro,

Arroget = trahant, afferat-38. Finis, ‘a delinition, tlte fixing ol a
definite time.’-42. Horace mentions here an absurdity connected
with the indiscriminate praise ol ancient authors; hemely, that
every author becomes good through tima-43. An admirer ol' the
old writers speaks. -47, Ratione ruentis accrvi, ‘in the same way

52. Somnio Pythagoreo. Ennius, in the commencemem of his great
work, the Annales. said that he had seen Homer in avision⁴ who
told lrim that his spirit had migrated (according to the doctrine os
Pythagoras) first into a peacoclr. and then into Ennius. Hence
Horacs's idea is: Ennius, who thought himself a second Homer,
and is so called by themidos, was yet ostelens-53. Cn. Naevius ¹
of Capua produced his first play on the Roman stage in the year
235 sc. He wrote also an epic poem on tlte F irst Punic War.
Noa est = nonne eat, a question of wonder, ‘do we not still read
Naevius l’ and yet he is tro preat poet. -·· ⁵⁵: Quoties ambigitur ater

than another’ in any department, the ancients only ere spoken os.-
56. Pacuvius, a native ol Brundusium and a nephew oi Ennius,
was a celebrated poet, distinguished particularly lor his mytholo-
gical lore. He was born irt aad a.c.‚ aad died in Tarentum at the
’ age ol ninety. As to Atrius, see Set. i. 10, 53.-57. L. Afranius,
who flourished about 94 a. c.‚ wrote sabulos togatam that &stabat-*t*
