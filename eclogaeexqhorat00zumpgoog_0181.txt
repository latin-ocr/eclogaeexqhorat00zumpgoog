Q. nonam renem

OARMEN XIV.-

AD AUGUSTUM.

ln the fourth ode 01 this book Horace had extolled the warlike deeds
01 Drusus, the younger of the emperor’s stepscns3 in this ode he
celebrates the victory gained hy Tiberius, the elder stepson‚ over
the Raetians. Howcver‚ the prudent poet so contrives that the
ode both begins and ends with the praises ofAugustus. Written
probably in the year 15 n. c.

Quas cura Patrum quaeve Qniritium
Plebis honorum muneribus tuas,
Auguste, virtutes in aevum

Per titulos memoresque fastos

Aeternetl ana sol habitabiles
Illustrat oras maxime principum,
Quem legis expertes Latinae
Vindelici didicere nuper,

Quid Marte posses. Milite nam tuo
Drusus Genaunos, implacidum genus,
Breunosque veloces et arces
Alpibus impositas tremendis

Dejecit acer plus viee simplici.
Major Neronum mox grave proelium
