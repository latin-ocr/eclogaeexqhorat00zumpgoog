An IULUM ANTONIUM.

Iu this ode Horace excuses himself for not attempting that losty
kind os lyric poetry which Pindar had cultivated among the
Greeks, but contenting himself with imitating the lighter songs
of Alcaeus and Sappho. The poem is addresscd to Mark
Antony’s son, Iulus Antonius, who was brought up by Augustus
and hie sister Octavia. At this time Antonius was held in
respect and honour3 so much so, indeed, that in the year 10
a. o, he obtained tho consulship. Alterwards, however, in 2 a.c.,
he was discovered to be implicated in a conspiracy against the

emperor, and was obliged to kill himself. The ode was written
shortly before 13 ac·

Fervet immensusque ruit profundo
