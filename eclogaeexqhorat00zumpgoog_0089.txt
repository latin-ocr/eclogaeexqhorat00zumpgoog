Q. ananan FLAOOI

Jam fulgor armorum fugaces
Terret equos equitumque vultus.

Audire magnos jam videor duces,
Non indecoro pulvere sordidos,¹
Et cuncta terrarum subacta
Praeter atrocem animum Catonis.

J uno et deorum quisquis amicior
Afris inulta cesserat impotens
Tellure, victorum nepotes
Rettulit inferias J ugurthae.

Quis nori Latino sanguine pinguior
Campus sepulchris impia roella
Testatur auditumque Me is
Hesperiae sonitum ruinael

Qui gurges ant quae flumina lugubris
Ignara petiit Quod mare Dauniae
Non decoloravere caedesl ³5
Quae caret ora cruore nostrol
