tinued his activity till ha had attained a considerable age. He
intended to conclude his poetical exertious with the first book of
the Epistles, which he published in the year 20 a. o, when he
was iu his sorry-fifth year. Hnwever, he still occasionally made
poema (particularly Odes, iv. 14) in celebration of exploits of
members cf the reigning family; and at last, long after the pub·
’ lication of the first three books cf Odes, he issued a fourth ς, and
besides, by the wish of Augustus, wrote the second book of
Epistles. lt is thus certain that Horace himself published his
· poema divided into books ς and in regard to the ⁸tfrs Portica alone,
it is a possible, but not a probable supposition, that it was issued
. after its author’s death. It seems likely, therefore, that all of
Horace’s poetry which he himself considered worthy of publi·
cation, bas come down to us. ’
Horace ccmmenced his poetical labours in his youth with sati·
rical poetry, which with him assumed two forma-the satire pro·
perly sc called, and the more lyrical epcde. ln the Satires, we
find no allusion to the battle of Actium, or to the events imme·
diately precediug3 they were therefore finished, and perhaps also
published before ³2 s. c. lt appears, moreover, that the two books
were issued together. They were composed on various occa·
sions, partly for the amusement of Maecenas’s socialcircle5 and
appear to have been intended originally entirely for the enter-
tainment of private friends. Horace read each separately to his
friends, ³9 he composed thern ; afterwards he divided thern into
books, and published them. They were followed by the book
of Epodes. Some of these Epodes were undoubtedly composed
long before3 but we find in the book allusions to the impending
battle between Antony arid Octavianus, which held all Italy iu
trembling anxiety, and-also a kind of triumphal song cn the
victory at Actium; so that the book seems to have been published
immediately after it. With the Epodes, Horace closed bis satirical
poetry. He had gained a name by it, but had also made himself
enemies3 and in his riper years he acknowledged that it was not
ι enough for a person to mark and satirica the faults of his fellcws,
but that he must himself attempt to produce something excellent.
He brought the hexameter of the Satires to perfectiori in the
Epistles, and changed the simple iarnbie verso of the Epodes for
the strict and artistic metros of the Odes. He finished the first
three books of the Odes about the year 20 a. o, and published
them together, as appears from the first Ode, and from the last
of the third book. The first book of thellpistles was also issued
in the year-20 a. c.; and with it, as we have already observed,
Horace intended to close his poetical career. But in 17 a. c., at
the emperor’s request, he wrote the Carmen saeculata,- and seon
afterwards-at all events before 13 a. c.-·he pontianae metemus
