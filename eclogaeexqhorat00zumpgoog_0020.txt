external advantages Horace was indebted ιο the favour aud
friendsbip os Maecenas: the literary friends whom he met at
hishouse encouraged him to poetical activity and to improve-
ment in the art, aud there, tco, he became acquainted with many
men of power aud influence in the state. It would have been
easy for him to alter his position iu regard to Maecenas, aud to
strike out for himself a path to honour aud authority3 but how
little he thought of this appears from his conduct to Augustus.
Maecenas had spoken of Horace to the emperor, and had given
him a copy of his poems; with which, being a manos taste, and
from disposition as well as from political motivas a patron of
literature, he expresscd himself as delighted. He wanted a
secretary to write letters for him, aud asked Maecenas to give
up Horace ιο him. Maecenas consented3 but Horace pleaded
the weak state of his health, to escape taking the office, which
would have given him much influence, but at the same time
much trouble. Angustus admitted the excuse, and was not
angry, buthe wished that Horace would speak of his exploits
in his poems, or rather that he would writea poem upon them,
aud he felt hurt that the poet had not mentioned himin any
previous productiou. But Horace declined to attempt any such
panegyric, bis reason being either that which he gave-namely,
that he had no taient sor epic poetry-or, as is more probable,
that he hated flattery. He had iu his youth belonged to the
republican party, and though in his maturet years be felt and
aclinowledged that the restoration of the republic was impossible,
and the government of Augustus beneficent, still he was unwill-
ing to act in such a manner as indirectly to depreciate the merita
of those heroes who had formerly been the gods os his idolatry.
But lre often praised the administrationes Augustus, which had,
in truth, induccd conteutment and excited gratitude in all-
extolling him sor having given to Italy aud the Roman Empire
the long wished-sor blessiugs of peace; for having, by successful
battles‚extendedand secured the boundaries of his dominions3
and for labouring most zealously, by good iustitutions and wisc
laws, to elevate the moral condition of the people. It was not
till aller pressiug requests from Augustus, which he could not
refuse without giving great offence, that Horace resolved ιο cele·
brute in two odes the victories ol Tiberius and Drusus, the step-
sons of the emperor, and sor this reason to add a fourth book
of Orles ιο the three which were already in the hands of the
public. Tlre epistle to Augustus (Epist. ii. 1) was written on the
saure occasion. ,

Maecenas, particularly when he grew old, and fell into bad
health, also made demands upon the poet which he could not
, reconcile with his principles; and this was probably the ream
