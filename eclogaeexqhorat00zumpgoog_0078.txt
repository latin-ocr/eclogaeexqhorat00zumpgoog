oARttIrvuM LIB. Ι.

Armenta, nou aurum aut ebur Indicum,
Non rura, quae Liris quieta
Mordet aqua, taciturnus amnis.

Premant Calena falce, quibus dedit
Fortuna, vitem3 dives et aureis
Mercator exsiccet culullis
Vina Syra reparata merce,

Dis carus ipsiS, quippe teret quater
Anno revisens aequor Atlanticum
Impune. Me pascunt olivae,

Me cichorea levesque malvae.
Frui paratis et valido mihi,
Latob, dones et precor integra
Cum mente nec turpem senectam
Degere neo cithara carentem. 20
