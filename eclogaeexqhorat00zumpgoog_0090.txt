OARMINUM LIB. 11. ·

Sed ne relictis, Musa procax, jocis
Ceae retractes munera naeniae:
Mecum Dionaeo sub antro
Quaere modos leviore plectro. 40

Dauniae, properly=Apulce (Carni. i. 22, 14); here=Romaace.-37.

The poet, when about to go on at some length wnh this lament over
the crvrl wara, recollects that his eneral purpose is to write only
jooular poenis (joci) of a lighter class (leuiore plectro), not ele ies
(naeniae) such as, erewhrle, therenowned poet, Simonides ol os,
eom used: hence, now, Horace restrains the gush ol his sorrow.-

39. iunceo sab antro. Dione, properly the mother ol' Venus,is
sometimes, as here, Venus herself.

Sannasrlus Cnrsros, grandson of the sister of the historiari, was a

eques, and the tranquil enjoyment of hi wealth. Horace praisos
him in this poem for the wise use which he makes of his fortune.
The ode was written about the year 25 n. o.

Splendeat usu.
