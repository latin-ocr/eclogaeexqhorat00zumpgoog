Honarui tempestas coelum contraxit, et imbres
Nivesque deducunt Jovem 3 nunc mare nunc silvae
Threicio aquilone sonant: rapiamus amice
Occasionem de die, dumque virent genua

Et decet, obducta solvatur fronte senectus.

Tu vina Torquato move consule pressa tneo. κ
Cetera mitte loqui: deus haec fortasse benigna
Rcducet in sedem vice. Nunc et Achaemenio
Persuadi nardo juvat ct fide Cyllenea

Levare diria pectora sollicitudinibus, 10
Nobilis ut grandi cecinit Centaurus alumno:
Invicte mortalis dea nate puer Thetide,

Te manet Assaraci tellus, quam frigida parvi
Findunt Scamandri flumina lubricus et Simois,
