'1⁸1ss praises ofcountry life. At the endofthe poem, ester descrih·
ing very beaudfnlly the pleneme ot' ι residence away from the
busy haunts of men, Horace turns the mutter into a Johnund
represents the picture which he hee drawn as merely an agree·
able fancy. We must not suppose, however, thet the poet really
preferred the town to the country. He did most sincerely love
the country, bnt his connection with Maecenas and other eircum-
stancec kept him much et Rome. Such time as he could spere,
he spent in the country, ond this kind os mixed town and coun-
try lise seems to heve suited him hest, for he does not deny that
he could not always enjoy the entire sedecion of the country.

erus ille qui procul negotiis,

Ut prisca gens mortalium,

Paterna rura bobus exercet suis,

Solutus omni fenore,

Neque excitatur classico miles truci, 5
Neque horret iratum mare,

Forumque vitat et superba civium ¹
Potentiorum limina.

Ergo aut adulta vitium propagine

Artas maritat populos,

Ant in reducta valle mugientium

Prospectat errantes greges,

Inutilesque falce ramos amputans

Feliciores inserit,

Aut pressa puris mella condit amphoris, 15
Aut tondet infirmas oves: '
Vel curn decorum mitibus pomis caput
Auctumnus agris extulit,

Ut gaudet insitiva decerpens pira

certantem et uvam purpurae, ω
Qua muneretur te, Priape, et te, pater

Silvane, tutor finium.

Libet jacere modo sub antiqua ilice,

Modo in tenaci gramine.
