not unsuccessfully. Horace, as it appears, became the chief lite·
rary assistant of Maecenas: he gave him information aboutnew
boclrs, helped him in his own compositione, and wrote poams for
his gratification and amusement. A great partos the Satires, for ,
instance, was undoubtedly intended primarily for Maecenas and
the intellectualcirclethat he had drawn around him. Horace
acted also as his secretary- in such state affairs as he had to attend
to. This is apparent from tha sixth Satira of the second book,
where a person requests Horace to obtain the signatura of Mae·
cenas to a paper, aslring his assistance quite in the style in which
ons addresses the secretary of a great man. ln one passage, also,
Horace complains that the amount of business which he has tego -
through at Rome preventa him from having any leisure. The
favour of Maecenas soon obtained for our poet the means of mak-
ing a sufficient livelihood: he became a scriba. This he himself
indicates in Sal. ii. 6, 363 and his biographer Suetonius says,
sciptum quaestorium comparavit—¹ he bought for himself a clerk-
sbip ιο the quaestore! These scibat formed by nc means aa
uninfluential class in Rome. They were the under-secretaries in
all the government departments, and the affairs os the state were
in a great measure managed by them. The chief secretaries were
changed annually, and consequeutly could be but very imper·
fectly acquainted with the duties of their office, which therefore

life. The state required from the scibat security for good con·
duct and integrity, and thus it happened that they formed a
strong and exclusive corporation3 and their offices became sale·
able, like commissione in the British army. As to’hcw Horace
contrived ιο unite his new duties with his employments at the
house of Maecenas, we ean only form conjectures. Either he was
allowed ιο perform the duties of scriba by prcxy, or he performed
them at the house of Maecenas, since the latter, being cflen
engaged in state affairs, could not dispensa with the attendance
of his secretary. This, however, is certain—that Horace gradu·
ally withdrew himself from business, and gained leisure enough
ιο follow his poetical inclinatione undisturbed.

At first, perhaps, Horace lived in the house of Maecenas, and
was treated as a dependant; butas the latter became more
acquainted with the pcet’s merita, he gave him greater freedcm
and independence. Let us now imagine to ourselves Horace's
condition aud mcdecf spending his time. He has his own bcuse
inmun, with three servants tc weit upon him. He has his own
particular friends aud associatae, but he goes, perhaps daily, at a
certain hour, to the house of Maecenas on the Esquiline Hill;
and ιο a special invitation from his patron even a promise rnade
ιο another must give way. Out of Rome, Horace possessas κ
