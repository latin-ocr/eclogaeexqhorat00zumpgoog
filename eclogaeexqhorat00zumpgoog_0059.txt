Q. nouam FLAGGI

lmbelli cithara carmina divides3
Nequicquam thalamo graves

Hastae et calami spicula Cnosii
Vitabis strepitumque et celerem sequi
Ajacem. Tamen heu serus adulteros
Cultus pulvere oollines. ,

Non Laertiaden, exitium tuae
Genti, non Pylium Nestora respicisl
Urgent impavidi te Salaminius
Teucer, te Sthenelus sciens

Pugnae, sive opus est imperitare equis,
Non auriga piger. Merionen quoque
Nosces, Ecce furit te reperire atrox
Tydides melior patre,

Quem tu, cervus uti vallis in altera
Visum parte lupum graminis immemor,
Sublimi fugies mollis anhelitu,

Non hoc pollicitus tuae.

Iracunda diem proferet Ilio

Matronisque Phrygum classis Achillei3
