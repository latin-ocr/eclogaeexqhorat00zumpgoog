QUANDO repostum Caecubum ad festas dapes
Victore laetus Caesare

Tecum subalta, sic lovi gratum, dorno,
Beate Maecenas, bibam, ’

Sonante mixtum tibiis carmen lyra,

Hac Dorium, illis barbaruml

Ut nuper, actus oum freto Neptunius

Dux sugit ustis navibus,

Minatus urbi vincla, quae detraxerat

Servis amicus perfidis.

Romanae, eheu, posteri negabitis,
Emancipatus seminas

Fert vallum et arma miles et spadonibus
servire rugosis potest, ,

Interque signa turpe militaria to
Sol adspicit conopium.
