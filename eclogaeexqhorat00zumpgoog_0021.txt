why, towards the end of his life, his visits ιο Rome became tewer
aud fewer. But, upon the whole, the connection between the two
friends remained the same, and ought always to be considered
as s pattern for the relations between an artist or poet and his
patron. The more the farne of Horace increased, the mors inti-
mate became his 'friendship with Maecenas. No petty jeslousy
interfered with their mutual affection and respect. Good for·
tane preserved the friends from the necessity of a separation,
and gratified the wish of Horace not to survive Maecenas long.
Maecenas died, aller a protracted illness, in the year 8 a. c.; and
when near his end,‘he commended our poet ιο Augustus in the
following words: Horatii Flacci, at md, memor esto. Horace fol·
lowed soon aster, ou the 27th os November in the sarne year,
having very nearly completed his fifty-seventh year. Death tecla

rather careless than elegant. In his mode of life he studied
comfort and ease, which never degenerated into luxury.

This, then, was the poet of whom Quintilian, the greatest of
Roman critica, remarks, that he was almost the only Latin lyrist
who deserved ιο be read-a judgment which has been fully rati·
fied by posterity; sor scarcely any nation has ever hed any lyrie
poet who has been so extensively read, admired, and imitated as
Horace. It is therefore worth while to say something regarding

is poetry iu general, aad regarding the kinds of poetry which
