AD LOLLIUM.

Teis ode is addressed to M. Lollius, consul in 21 'a o.‚ a man who
at one time possessed in a high degree the confidence of Augus-
tus, but lost it by his ingratitude and insatiable avarice. In the
first part ofthis ode Horace treats of a subject similar to that of

· the preceding ; namely‚ the power of pects to confer immortality:
in the second part he praiscs Lollius, saying much—perhaps nqt

without special design-of temporanee and inaccessibility to

bribes.

Nn forte credas interitura, quae
Longe sonantem natus ad Aufidum
Non ante vulgatas per artes
Verba loquor socianda chordis:
Non, si priores Maeonius tenet
Sedes Homerus Pindaricae latent
Ceaeque et Alcaei minaces
Stesichorique graves Camenae;
‚Nec, si quid olim lusit Anacreon,
Delevit aetas5 spirat adhuc amor
Virumque commissi calores
Aeoliae fidibus puellae.

l. Neforte credas. The spodosis begins with line 5.-2. Ad
longe sonantem Aufidum? See iii. 30, 10.-3. Non onte vulgatas
per artes ,· namely‚ lyric poetry. See iii. 30, 13. This ars is more
particularly defined, as verbo socienda chordis, ‘words to be con·
nected with the strings.’ sorigs which are intended and ought to be
sung to the lyre. - 5. Priores sedes. He might also have said pri·
mos sedes, but, strictly speakio„ there is only a comparison be-
tween two parties- Homer on t e one side, and all other poets oa
the other: hence the comparative. Homer is called diaconias, srom
Macen, which was said to be the name os his lothen-6. Pindari·
cue- Camenae, ‘the poenis of Pindar :¹ see iv. 2, 1. Ceoe relersro
the poerns of Simonides, a renowncd elegist, who was a native ol
the island os Ceos. The songs of Alcaeus are called minaces, be·
cause they were partly war-songs, partly calis to expel the tyrants
Pittacus and Myrsilus from Lesbos. Stesichorus, too, wrote war·
songs, and was, as it were, an epic poet in lyric dress: hence gravis.

which light kind os poetry lusit is properly used-lo. spiramus&
