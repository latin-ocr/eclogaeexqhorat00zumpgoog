Q. HORATII sunum

Tum spissa ramis laurea fervidos
Excludet ictus. Non ita Romuli
’ Praescriptum et intonsi Catonis ’

Templa novo decorare saxo. 20

Romans built particular rooms for the summer season, which laced
the north, and consequently were shedy, and received the cooling
northern breezes. The winter rooms louked to the south. Con·

erected. On the other hund, the public buildings, even at this esrl
period, were built nouo snam nor with the stones ol Italy, but with
new, far·letched stone ; thetis, morhle.
