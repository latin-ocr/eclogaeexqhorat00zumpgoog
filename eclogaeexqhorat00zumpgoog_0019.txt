1 INTRODUOTION.

small estate-either a direct present from Maecenas, or obtained
by bis influence, as compensation sor the patrimonial property
which had been assigned tothe veterane. This estate is the pride
and joy of the poet's beart: here he seels bappyin rnral seclusion
and simplicity3 and hither he invites (repeatedly in bis Odes)
hisparticular friends, is they wish to enjoy country lise. He isin
Rome only during the time when he must be there-namely, the
beginning of the year. He returns tobis Sabine sarm as soon as
he possibly can, and lives there for the remainder of the year;
except when be goes, us the state os bis bealtlr osten obliges him
to do, to the warrn baths of Baiae, or to the sea-batbing at some
· town in southern Italy.

The situation and appearance os this celebrated sarm may be
pretty well determined from the notices which he gives in Epist.
i. 14, to, and 18, and sat. ii. 6. We erossover to the right bank
os the Anio at Tibur (the modern Tivoli), and then go up along
the river, following the tn'a Valerio, as far as the little village os
Varia (now Vicovaro.) This village lies to the lellof the public
read, on a hill above the Anio, eight Roman miles from Tibur.
Horuce's estate was in tbe district connected with this village;
and bad, in earlier times, when landed property in Italy was
distributed among more persons, sufficed sor the support os five
families: now it waecultivated sor Horace by eight slaves. It
was situated in a valley, which lay in the direction from north to
south 3 so that the hill on the right was gilded by the bearns ostbe
morning sun, theton the leil by his evening rays. A consider·
able rivulet, called the Digentia (now Licenza), flows through
the middle oi the valley, falling into the Anio abouta mile above
Varia Thus sartha locality is certain, andcan at presenteasily
be found ; but the exact place where the villa stood it is scarcely
possible to fix, since it was certainly not so magnificent or lasting
that traces os it should remain till now· Horace, in Odes iii. 13,
mentions a fona Bandusiae ae springing up near his farm. Isthis
was the largest ol the numerous broolrs which bubble up on the
slope of tbe hill on the right side of the Digentia, then the villa
’ must bave been situated soma three miles up the valley. There
was connected with this house in the country a house in Tibur,
according to a custom which still holds in the smaller towns os
Italy, that toeach house a certain piece of land belongs, on which
again may be a villa. The poet, therefore‚osten praises Tibur aa
bis derling residence, where the Muses favoured him most, and
where be wished that he rnightremain inbisold age. Suetonius,
in his biography os Horace, says, Vtar plurimum in eccetan rutis
rai Sabiniani Tiburtini: domitaque ejas ostenditur circe Tiburni
lamium 'Now the grove os Tiburnus, an old local god of Tibur,
must bave been in, or at least very near, the town. For these
