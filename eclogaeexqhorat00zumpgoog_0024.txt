modelled it, and was the first to bring it into general notice. This
kind os poetry was unknown to the Greeks: its placa was sup·
plied by what was called theold Comedy, withwhich Horace, in
desending his Satires, classes them. The Drama Satyriccm was
a parody on tragady. The Latin word tutuo is not connected
with the satyrs or the Drama Satyricvm: it comes from the ad·
jective cutm, ‘sull, heaped up.¹ Hence satura means originally,
‘a heaping up, mixiug together of heterogeneous things,’ either in
offerings made to thegods, or in laws which embraced various
subjecta per saturum, ‘in the gross or slump.’ Hence the old
Roman poeta Ennius and Pacuvius called a poem written in
various kinds ol verse, and probably ol a comic nature, a sutura.
Lucilius, about me year 120 ac, retained the name, applying it
to a regular hexameter poem, os th0 class now called aetites,
which he divided into thirty books. This originated the satire,
and Horace expressly mentions Lucilius as its inventor. Horace,
however, made an improvement on its character. He gave up
personal attacks, and the assailing os particular individuale: sor
this he made use ol his Epodes. In his Satires he lashes not single
sools, but lools as a class-solly generally. The satire with him
is a didactic poem3 it gives instruction in the philosophy os life,
and particular persons mentioned are introduced merely as il·
lustrative examples. There are marked features ol distinction also
between Horace and his successore as Roman salirists, Juvenal
aad Persius, whose works are still extant. Lucilius had been
entirely personal, aud principallypolitica15 Horace, in another
age and under other political circumstances, took only the sollies
ol mankind as hie subject: he was worldly-wise, and endeavoured
to teach by showing where error lay. Juvenal inveighs against
viee with ardour and indignatiou3 Persius was a noble· youth,
os noble spirit, desimus to regulata life according to the maxims
os the Stoic philosophy. In style, Lucilius was very sree5 J uve·
nal is rhetorical and regular, Persius difficult‚epigrammatic, and
full of obscurity. Horace retains throughout the tone os witty,
familiar conversation. It is sor this reason that he seems to have
given to his work, though including it in the species os poetry
called satire, the distinctive name ol' Sermones (ι conversationes)
This accounts also both sor the fact, that his Satires are generally
in the form os entertaining narrative, and sor the peculiarities of
their language and metra. In style, he keeps as close as possible
to that os polished prosa; indeed he speaks once of the muta

pedestris in his Satires. In regard to metro, he so constructe his
hexameters that they are very different iiom the sounding lines
ol* heroic poetry. It would have been easier ior him, as we cun
partly see stom the Epistles, to follow the epic hexameters ol
Virgil; but he would not do it, that he might preserve aa ὼν
