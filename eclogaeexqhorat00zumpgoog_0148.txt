Immanis aram si tengomenas, ·
Non sumptuosa blandior hostia
Mollivit aversos Penates
Ferre pio et saliente nriea. 20

large offerings. Immanis is used in its strict et molegical sense =
sine manere, ‘without a present.'-l9. Aversor enarer, ‘the angry
Penates,’ who, to show their wuith, have turned away their iaces.
-ffl For (coarse meai) aud mico saliens (salt which, when thrown
into the firii' crackles and emita sparks) were main constituente of
