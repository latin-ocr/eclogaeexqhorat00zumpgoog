Q Daunius, to whom this poem is adorasset, was one of that nu-
merous class ofRomans, who, not possessing any spirit of poli-
tieel independenoffiand being heedless of, if indeed they had,
any inward convietion, were content, during the civil ware, to
follow the majority, and the tide of success. He had been con-

favour with Augustus. This ode, however, has no reference to

· his character or politioul relations, but is simply an exhortation
to eujoy life temperately‚ never going to creasses either of joy
or sorrow.

Festos reclinatum bearis
Interiora nota Falerni.
