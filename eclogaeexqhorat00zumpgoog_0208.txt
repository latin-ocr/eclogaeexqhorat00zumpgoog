Arnai of fancy. 'I'he poet calls upon the Romans to emigrato
hom Italy, where civil war is constantly breaking out anew‚ te
the islands of the blest. These islands on the west coast of
Africa, now the canarias, were famed throughout all antiquity
for their salubrious climate, their existence and nature, however,
being treated more as poetieal fancies than realities. Even the
most ancient Greeks had an undelined and vague knowledge of
them, and the poets described thern as tho happy abode of the
spirits of men. The Roman general, Sertorius, having found
himself unable to make head in Spain against Pumpey, intended
to retire with his followers to the happy islands3 but of actual
settlements‚ or of the foundation of any towns on them by the
Romans, there is no record. The neglect of the Romans, to die-
cover aad make use of the islands on the African coast is sur·
prising, and ean only be acoounted for by the fact, that there
was still land enough, thinly peopled‚ on the continentes Europe,
to receive any surplus population of ltaly.

'this poem seems to be one of Horace's earliest, and to refer netto
the Actian war, but rather to the hostilities between the Caesa·

the legions in Italy, hy which many cities lost their property.
