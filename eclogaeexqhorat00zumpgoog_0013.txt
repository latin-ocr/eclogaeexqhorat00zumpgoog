and aster him many learned men directed their attention to the ¹
explanation oi Horace's language and allusione, till the time of
Richard Bentley, whose first edition was published at Cambridge
in 1711. Bentley, by this edition, established his fame as a
deoided genius in criticism. He altered the textos Horacein
about eight hundred passages, osten according to tlte readings oi
manuscripts (sor he bad many, and some were excellent); osten
also, however, upon simple conjecture. More modern critice
have perceived that many olBentley’s corrections were not what
the poet wrote, but merely what he might have written. But
· e'veu in his unsuocesssul emendations, he has aliorded to later
critica and commentatore rich and interesting materials for de-
bate, srom which none has been able to escape. ln tlte present
edition, considering that it is intended chiefly sor sclroola, we
have seldom mentioned Bentley’s name; but in many cases we
have been unable to resrain from torrclring, generally in a very
few words, upon points about which he has raised controver-
sies. The directiou that the criticism on Horace has talreu since
Bentley's time is the poetieoaesthetio, the character of which is
best developed in Mitscherlioh's somewhat diffuse, but yet erudite
and judicious edition os the Odes (Leipzig, 1800.) Very recently,
Jo. Casp. Orelli-whose third edition has appeared iu the year
taso-has endeavoured to combine the explanatory and aesthetie
style of commentary 'with a new critical receusion. We have
taken his text as the basis of ours; paying caresul regard, how·
ever, both to former editions of all Horace’s worlts, aud also to
the numerous editions os detached portione os them; among
which L. F. Heindorfs edition of the Satires (Second, Leipzig,
1843) deserves particular notice.

The present edition contains nearly all the poema of Horace,
those only having been excluded which cannot· be mede use os
lor educational purposes. The commentary was began by Pro·
sessor c.'G. Zumpt. He died, however, without completing more
than the notes on the Epodes. The remainder the undersigned
has endeavoured to executa iubis father's spirit.
