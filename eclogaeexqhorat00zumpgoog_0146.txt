CARMINUM IrIB. 111.

Seu risam et insanos amores
Seu facilem, pia testa, somnum,

Quocunque lectum nomine Massicum
Servas, moveri digna bono die,
Descende, Corvino jubente
Promere languidiora vina.

Viresque et addis cornua pauperi,

Post te neque iratos trementi .
Regum apices nepus militum arma.

Segnesqne nodum solvere Gratiae

to bring down milder (that is, older) wine (languidiora viaa; see iii.

impertinent enough to assume the master m his friend’s house. - 9.
The word madet is often used of one who has drunk plentifully os
wine: hence it is here applied to Corvinus, as'full ol such conver·
