GARMINUM LIB- 1v.

Vernique jam nimbis remotis
Insolitos docuere nisus
Venti aventem, mox in ovilia
Demisit hostem vividus impetus,
‚ Nunc in reluctantes dracones
Egit amor dapis atque pugnae3 ⁶

Qualemve laetis caprea pascuis
Intenta, fulvae matris ab ubere
Jam lacte depulsum leonem
Dente novo peritura vidit;

Videre Raetis bella sub Alpibus
Drusum gerentem Vindelici3 (quibus
Mos unde deductus per omne
Tempus Amazonia securi

Dextrae obarmet, quaerere distuli,
Neo scire fas est omnia ς) sed diu
Lateque victrices catervae
Consiliis juvenis revictae

triae vigor, ‘ hereditary boldness or energy.’ - 8. Docucre- ocuti.
Other birds learn to fly in calm westher, but the young eagle makes
the wind its teaoher: herein consists its similarity to young Drusus.
-10. Vividrta. The use of the word iu the seoondary sense which
it has here is rare and remarkable-ll. Nunc, answering to the
preceding moa. The eagle first learns to flyr theu it seelrs as prey
animale which can make no resistance3 and finally, it is ready lor
battle. Reluctenter dracones. Homer (Iliad, xii. 200) has a descrip-
tion of a fight between an eagle and a serpent, which many other
ancient poets have imitated-14. Ab ubere jum lacte depulsum.
Both ob ubere and lacte depend upon depulsum the former indicat-
lng more the position, the latter the occupation3 so that lecte depol-
tt1h⁰t¹tttlt¹lhattl‘tlpltthttttlltlhtrtltttttt {3
denote removal srom position. - 16. Dente novo, ‘by its teeth, new
to devouring3' that is, which have not hitherto been used for this
wora-17. Videre. Supply talen, to correspond with quatem in
lines 1 and 13. Raetia subAlpt'bus-Vr'ndelr'ei. The Vindeliciens
dwelt between the Danube, the river Aenus, aud the Lucus Brigan-
tinus. Their chief town was Augusta Vindelicorum, now Au s·
burg. The country of the Raetians lay south from that of the ru·
delicians, and extended as lar as Verona and Comum. These na·
tiens were subduedb Drusus and Tiberius, the former conquering
the Vindelicum, the lla-tter the Raetians. Compare iv. 14, 15. The
Raetran Alps, at the loot ol which the Vindelrcrans are here said
to see Drusus warring, are the mountaius about Verona. -1a The
parenthesis beginning with quibus, and ending with omnia in line
22. appears somewhat unpoetical, and also foreign to the subject os
the whole ode. But this is not a sufficient reason for considering it,
as some have done, an interpolation. Construe thus·. <thautanes-
