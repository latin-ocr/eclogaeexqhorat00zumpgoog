Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos,

Vivunt et rigidi Getae,

Immetata quibus jugera liberas
Fruges et Cererem lerunt,

Nec cultura placet longior annua,

Defunctumque laboribus

Aequali recreat sorte vicarius.

Privignis mulier temperat innocens,

Nec dotata regit virum

Conjnx, nec nitido fidit adultero.
Dos est magna parentium

Virtus et metuens alterius viri

Et peccare nefas aut pretium est mori.
Ο quisquis volet impias

Caedes et rabiem tollere civicam,

Si quaeret aaran uastum

Subscribi statuis, indomitam audeat
Refrenare licentiam,
