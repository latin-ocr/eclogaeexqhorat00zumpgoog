AD mammis.

A rinnon invitation addressed ta virgil. He is to bring with him
a bor of ointment, whilst Horace will supply a pitchor of wine
whether the poet Vergil be ineant, to whom the third ode of the
first book refers, or some other Virgilius to us unknown, we have
no means of ascertaining. 1f we believe the poet to be meant
then we must suppose the ode to have been written earlier than
the others in this book, for virgil died in 19 a. c. Aa to the date
of the publication oftbis book, see the introduction.
