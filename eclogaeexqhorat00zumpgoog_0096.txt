OARMINUM IdB. 11.

Cnm qao morantem saepediem mero
Fregi coronatus nitentes ⁶
Malobathro Syrio capillos.

Tecum Philippos et celerem fugam
Sensi, relicta non bene parmula,

Cum fracta virtus et minaces

Turpe solum tetigere mento.

, Sed me per hostes Mercurios celer
Denso paventem sustulit aere3

Te rursus in bellum resorbens

Unda fretis tulit aestuosis.

Ergo obligatam redde Jovi dapem,
Longaque fessum militia latus
Depone sub lauru mea, nec
Parce cadis tibi destinatis. .

Unguenta de conchis, Quis udo

malobathro, ‘hair shining wnh Syrian malobathrum’ This was an
Indian plant. from whose leaves an oil was pr'essed3 here the oil
itself-IO. Relicta aon bene armato. 'l‘his is a famous expression
of Horace, in regard to the oiose ol' his military career. The phrase
rs to be considered as a poetical mode of indicating and describing
the loss of the battle. Horace, neither less brave nor less oowardl
than his follow-solatas, fled along with them, when the deatii
of Cassius and Brutus made it evident that victory was rm-
possible-11. Miaoces, ‘those who formerly had threatened with
their weapons! What follows is again merelya poetical descrip-
tion of a defeat in general-14. Denso-aere, ‘concealed by a thick
cloud,’ in the same manner as heroes in Homer arc often with·
drawn from the midst of battles, enveloped by their nardian divi·
nities in mists ao dense, that the foos find themseives at fanlt.
Horace, as a poet, was under the special protection of Mercnry.
Compare ii. 17, 29.- 16. 'l'he figure is taken from the wavos of the
sea, which, when receding from the beach, often carry away what
they have ‘nst before thrown up. Fretr's aestuosis. ‘in the boiling

There is here a slight touch of irony in rogard to Horace himself:
corne to me and rest in my house. the house which l bave gained
by my laurcls, be they military or poetic-22, Cibaria, a liind of
lame caps. in form resembling the pods of tlte 'dignariam neam.
